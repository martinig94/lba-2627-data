# LBA Serie A 2026/27 — game-by-game data

Incremental collector for the Italian basketball league (Lega Basket Serie A) 2026/27 season,
built on the undocumented JSON API behind [legabasket.it](https://www.legabasket.it).
It runs every Monday morning on GitHub Actions, collects any newly finished games, and commits
the updated dataset — so `data/` grows on its own through the season.

Season context: 16 teams, 30 rounds (andata/ritorno). Two Rome teams — **BC Roma** (team_id 1761,
ex Vanoli Cremona) and **Maxima Roma** (team_id 1762, ex Germani Brescia).

## Data

| file | grain | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data/games.csv` | one row per game (all 240 scheduled) | scores, quarter scores, venue, attendance, coaches; `game_status` 2 = finished |
| `data/box_scores.csv` | one row per player per game, plus `team` and `total` rows | minutes, pts, FG2/FG3/FT made+attempted, reb (O/D), ast, stl, tov, blk, fouls, `val` (LBA efficiency), `oer`, `plus_minus`, `starter` |
| `data/pbp.csv` | one row per play-by-play event | period, clock, running score, player, event type (Italian: "2 punti segnato", "Rimbalzo difensivo", "Ingresso"/"Uscita" = substitutions…), shot type qualifier, **x/y court coordinates (0–100)**, zone |
| `data/teams.csv` | teams of the season | team ids are re-issued each season — don't join across seasons on id |
| `data/raw/<game_id>/*.json` | untouched API payloads | lets you rebuild the CSVs offline (`python -m lba_data.rebuild`) |

Coordinates: `x` runs along the length of the court (each team attacks one half; `side`
flips per team/half), `y` across the width. Percent of court, not metres — calibrate
against the 3pt line (~6.75 m) before computing distances.

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m lba_data.collect            # pull whatever is new
python -m lba_data.collect --limit 2  # test run
python -m pytest -q                   # unit tests against a real Round 1 payload
```

## Analysis starter

```python
import pandas as pd
box = pd.read_csv("data/box_scores.csv")
players = box[box.row_type == "player"]
roma = players[players.team.isin(["BC Roma", "Maxima Roma"])]
roma.groupby(["team", "player_surname"])[["pts", "reb", "ast", "val", "plus_minus"]].mean()
```

## Caveats

* Not an official API. Endpoints were mapped from the site's network traffic in Sept 2026 and can
  change without notice — if a run fails, check `lba_data/api.py` first.
* Be polite: the collector sleeps between games and only fetches games it hasn't stored yet.
* Box scores appear within minutes of the final buzzer, but stats can be corrected in the days
  after. The collector doesn't re-fetch a game once stored; delete `data/raw/<game_id>` and
  re-run to refresh one.
* Playoffs are a separate championship id; add it with `--champ <id>` when the time comes.
