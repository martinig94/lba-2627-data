"""Thin client for the (undocumented) legabasket.it JSON API.

Endpoints were discovered by watching the network traffic of the official
site (Next.js app) in September 2026. They are public and need no auth, but
they are not a supported API: expect them to change without notice.

    GET /api/championships/get-championships?s=<year>&cs_id=1&items=1000
        -> competitions for a season (cs_id=1 is Serie A). Regular Season
           2026/27 is championship id 602.
    GET /api/teams/get-teams?year=<year>&items=50
        -> the 16 teams of that season. NOTE: team ids are re-issued every
           season (Milano was 1649 in 2024/25, 1751 in 2026/27).
    GET /api/championships/get-championships-calendar-by-id?id=<champ>&d=<giornata>
        -> matches of one round ("giornata"); `filters.days` lists all rounds.
    GET /api/championships/get-championships-matches-by-id?id=<game>
        -> match header (teams, venue, quarter scores, coaches, referees).
    GET /api/championships/get-championships-matches-scores-by-id?id=<game>&info=true
        -> full box score: scores.ht / scores.vt each with rows (players),
           totals and team (team rebounds etc.).
    GET /api/championships/get-championships-matches-play-by-play?id=<game>&info=true&sort=asc
        -> pbp.actions: every event with period, clock, score, player, team,
           x/y (0-100, % of the court) and shot/foul qualifiers; `legend`
           maps qualifier codes to descriptions.
    GET /api/matches/get-championship-matches-shots-by-id?id=<game>&info=1
        -> zone-aggregated shooting per team (derived; the pbp has the raw shots).
